# README

app requirement
We want a web application for course management and student management. It is like some other university where we have few courses which are taught by instructors. Course has couple of grading instruments such as assignments, quizzes and exams. We want student enrollment feature as well where each student can go to the system and selects one or many courses he or she wants to study. There should be  teacher dashboard, student dashboard and admin side as well for all these management. Teacher should be able to see the enrollments in his course, can create any grading instruments, can grade students through those instruments. On the student side, a student can do enrollment, can view grading instruments and should be able to attempt them as well. Admin will be able to add teachers and students in the system. Admin should also be able to create course and assign the course to single or multiple instructors.
